The ICS Technician introduced various vulnerabilities into the ICS system.  These vulnerabilities are then exploited by the hacker or eavesdropper to gain access to the ICS system or compromise the confidentiality of the system.  In this scenario, the ICS technician receives no training which leads to a misconfiguration of the ICS system and also the introduction of a rogue access point in the ICS network. Another vulnerability associated with the ICS technician is giving the technician unrestricted system access.   In this scenario a hacker can attack the ICS system by means of social engineering, where the hacker tricks the ICS technician into releasing information, or discovering the rogue access point and using that to gain access to the network.
