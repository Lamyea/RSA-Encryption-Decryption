The purpose of these essays is to present some of the material that is the basis of security in computer systems.  An attempt has been made to include examples in order to make the difficulty of many of the concepts apparent.  It is all too easy to state glibly that a system is required to include a reference monitor, or that controls on covert channels will be enforced, or that the network will be secure against unauthorised observation of traffic, or a myriad of other requirements.  Usually, such things imply a major development issue, because always the devil hides in the details. No attempt has been made to include everything.  Notable missing areas are security protocols1, database security2, the least privilege principle3, modern work on cryptography and cryptographic algorithms4, public key cryptosystems5 and the recent work on the composition problem6.  There are many other subjects that might have been covered, but it is felt that these essays provide sufficient background so that people who are developing an interest in computer security can appreciate many of the follow-on issues that are the focus of present research activity. These essays were originally conceived as some handouts to a course in computer security that was started in 1993 in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Toronto.  These essays were drawn from the handouts for the spring of 1995. In all cases an attempt has been made to include references to original material.  However, much of this material is not easily accessible. In these cases rather more detail is included that might be otherwise strictly necessary. Great thanks must go to those authors who developed the material upon which the essays are based.  Several hundred students also merit thanks.  Without their attention and probing questions the essays would contain many more absurdities and errors than they still do
